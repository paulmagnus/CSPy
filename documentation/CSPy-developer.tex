\section{Introduction}
This is the documentation for CSPy, a strongly-typed Python dialect for use in learning environments. This is the Ulysses version, which is the third version of the dialect. It succeeds the Jabberwocky version made by Lyndsay LaBarge '17 and Maya Montgomery '18, which is itself preceded by a foundation written by Alex Dennis '18 and Eric Collins '17. We thank those responsible for earlier versions for making our lives easier and providing a suitable framework for our improvements.

\subsection{What is CSPy?}
CSPy is a strongly-typed dialect of Python. Python by itself is not strongly typed and because of this, new programmers that use Python can use it in bad ways, like creating variables that end up not being used, or by setting a variable of a specific type to another type. With CSPy, we are more up front about these problems. Any things have to be named at the start of each function definition or class definition or program, and CSPy makes sure each thing is used and is not changed to a different thing by the writer. These things make it easy to teach future programmers about programming languages, and helps to make learning other object oriented programming languages easier in the future.

\subsection{How To View And Use This Document}
This document should be used to aid a developer's analysis of the CSPy backend, and CSPy's Text Editor. It will describe in detail how each part of the CSPy backend works, starting with the master file, then delving into CSPy's lexer and parser, the data structures used throughout the program, the environment generator, the type checker, and then the runtime. After that will be discussion on improvements we have made, such as importing of Python files and the CSPy Text Editor (as well as what aspects we included and what design choices we made in assuring an easy to use IDE for beginning students). Functional development recommendations will be at the end of this document. 

The authors advise against printing out this document, as it is lengthy and generally not designed for print form. If you have to print this document, print double sided. This document is rendered using \LaTeX. A \verb|.tex| file is provided in the documentation folder within the CSPy directory if you wish to edit this document or the CSPy Ulysses Documentation for Student And Teacher Usage document.

\subsection{Contact Information}
Please send CSPy and graphical environment issues to pmagnus@hamilton.edu, any issues related to the CSPy editor to iayara@hamilton.edu, and any documentation and graphical environment issues to mjenkins@hamilton.edu. We will be happy to fix anything you find. If any of us are unable to be reached, please email acampbel@hamilton.edu and he'll forward any issues to us.

\section{CSPy Master Documentation}
The file \verb|cspy_master.py| runs everything that is necessary for CSPy to work. It analyzes the code, type checks everything, and runs the code. The steps of this process are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb|cspy_master| sets up the lexer and parser using rules defined in \verb|cspy_lexer| and \verb|cspy_parser| files, then runs the lexer and parser on the CSPy file. (This uses PLY, an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.) This process returns a parse tree, which is an abstract syntax tree and whose definition is defined in \verb|cspy_data_struct|.

\item \verb|cspy_master| checks the parse tree for imported files. Once that is finished, master begins a compilation process (steps 1-5) on any imported files. Once that finishes, the generated parse trees are used to add any methods and attributes used in the parent file.

\item \verb|cspy_master| passes the parse tree to \verb|cspy_genenv|, which adds environments in proper scope to appropriate nodes in the tree.

\item \verb|cspy_master| passes the parse tree to \verb|cspy_type_checker| and checks each node for type errors. If an error is found, the program quits and outputs a personalized error message. Otherwise, the parse tree gets sent to \verb|cspy_translate|.

\item \verb|cspy_translate| translates each line of code into Python 2.7 and writes it into a new.py file. It also writes a dictionary which maps each line in the CSPy file to lines in the new .py file.

\item Finally, \verb|cspy_master| calls \verb|cspy_runtime|, which executes the Python file. Any runtime errors are caught and displayed in a simplified manner, and the line the error was found on is substituted for the corresponding line in the CSPy file. Once everything is finished executing, any generated files are deleted.
\end{enumerate}

\verb|cspy_genenv|, \verb|cspy_type_checker|, and \verb|cspy_translate| all import and make use of the files\\ % document overflow problem
\verb|cspy_builtins| and \verb|cspy_data_struct| in order to create and edit the parse tree and to type-check built in functions and types.

If an error is found in a .cspy file, any .py or .txt files created in the compilation process will be removed before the program terminates. At any location with a planned system exit, such as in type error in \verb|cspy_type_checker|, the function \verb|remove_files| is called. The master writes the names of any imported .cspy files as well as the main .cspy file to a .txt file to \verb|/tmp/$USER|, so \verb|remove_files| may read in the names of the files to search for. Note that this .txt file must be closed after writing each name, because if the file object is open when an error is found, \verb|remove_files| will not be able to access the names. More information on this can be found in the \verb|cspy_runtime| documentation. 

Currently, the command to run any CSPy file is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
python2.7 cspy_master.py filename.cspy
\end{verbatim}
Within \verb|/bin/| there is an executable called \verb|cspy| which shortcuts this process:
\begin{verbatim}
/bin/cspy filename.cspy
\end{verbatim}

\section{CSPy Lexer Documentation}
(NOTE: For further documentation on PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), please visit the original creator's documentation located at http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html.)
\subsection{PLY Lex and Tokens}
A lexer is used to tokenize an input string. It splits a string into individual tokens. Tokens are usually given a name to indicate what they are.

According to the PLY model, all token identifiers must be contained within a list assigned to the variable 'tokens'. In this sense, 'tokens' is a reserved word and cannot be used in any other context. Each token identifier corresponds to a variable or function whose identifier is prefixed with '\verb|t_|', another naming system specific to PLY. Anything that follows '\verb|t_|' must be a token identifier and a member of the tokens list. 

\verb|cspy_lexer.py| contains variables and functions which define the tokens in the CSPy language (following the naming system outlined in the PLY documentation). 

\subsection{Token Identifiers and Regular Expressions}
Each variable or function prefixed with '\verb|t_|' and followed by a token identifier is assigned a regular expression which corresponds to the token name. For example, any string matching the regular expression '\verb|[0-9]+|' will be classified as an '\verb|INTLITERAL|' token:
\begin{verbatim}
t_INTLITERAL = r'[0-9]+'
\end{verbatim}
Token definitions using variables are added to the lexer in order of decreasing regular expression length. This means '\verb|==|' will be added to lexer before '\verb|=|', and any string containing two equals signs will match the first regular expression, not the second. 

Token definitions using functions are added to the lexer before definitions using variables and in the order they are listed in the lexer file. 

The first line in a token definition must always be a regular expression. Consider the token definition for an '\verb|IDENTIFIER|' token below:
\begin{verbatim}
def t_IDENTIFIER(t):
    r'[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*'
    t.type = reserved.get(t.value, 'IDENTIFIER')
    if t.value == 'True' or t.value == 'False':
        t.type = 'BOOLLITERAL'
    return t
\end{verbatim}
Note that the first line of the function is a regular expression corresponding to an identifier in CSPy, which can begin with a lowercase or uppercase alphabetic character, and can be followed by any number of underscores or alphanumeric characters. 

The parameter '\verb|t|' is a \verb|LexToken| object. \verb|LexToken| objects have a type attribute, a value attribute, and a lexer attribute. The type attribute is the token identifier, e.g. '\verb|INTLITERAL|', and the value attribute is the input string corresponding to the identifier, e.g. '\verb|7|'. The lexer attribute is the lexer which the token has been tokenized by. 

All token definitions using functions must return '\verb|t|' or else the token object will disappear once the function finishes executing.

\subsection{Reserved Words}
In addition to the tokens list, cspy lexer.py also contains a dictionary of reserved words whose keys are reserved CSPy words and whose values are token identifiers corresponding to their keys, e.g. \verb|'if' :'IF' |, \verb|'else' : 'ELSE'|.

Unlike the rest of the token identifiers, reserved words do not have to corresponding '\verb|t_|' variables or functions. Any reserved word will match the regular expression for an identifier. The '\verb|t_INDENTIFIER|' function defined above will assign the type attribute of the \verb|LexToken| to a reserved words token identifier if the value of the token is in the dictionary of reserved words. If the identifier is not a reserved word, the \verb|LexToken| type attribute will simply be '\verb|IDENTIFIER|'.

\subsection{Ignore}
\verb|t_ignore| is a special token definition. It is a regular expression that specifies which characters can be ignored by lexer (usually whitespace). The CSPy lexer ignores space and tab characters that do not relate to line indentation, e.g. spaces between letters, etc.
\begin{verbatim}
t_ignore_WS = r'[ \t]'
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Line Numbers}
By default, the lexer does not keep track of new lines. The lineno attribute of the lexer must be updated manually whenever the lexer encounters a newline token. The CSPy lexer keeps track of line numbers by updating the lexer's lineno attribute in \verb|t_CONTLINE| and \verb|t_pass_start|.

\subsection{Indentation}
Additional attributes for a PLY lexer can be created after a lexer object has been created. In \verb|cspy_master.py|, the CSPy lexer is assigned two additional attributes, \verb|indentstack| and \verb|indentedline|. \verb|indentstack| is a stack containing the indentation levels of the program, where the indentation level on the top of the stack is the current indentation level in the lexing process.

Indentation is handled by \verb|t_indent_INDENT|.

\subsection{Illegal Characters}
Whenever the lexer encounters illegal characters (like '\verb|$|'), \verb|t_error| is invoked and a syntax error message is displayed containing the CSPy line and line number, along with '\verb|^|'s pointing to the illegal character(s). After displaying the error message, the lexer skips over the illegal character(s) and continues tokenizing the input stream.

\section{CSPy Parser Documentation}
(NOTE: For further documentation on PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), please visit the original
creator's documentation located at http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html.)
\subsection{Set Up}
\verb|cspy_parser.py| contains a multitude of functions whose names are prefixed with '\verb|p_|', as per the PLY model. Each function takes a single variable, \verb|p|, which is a \verb|LexToken| created by the CSPy Lexer (see lexer documentation for more details). The very first line of each function is a docstring, which corresponds to a grammar rule and uses the following format, where '\verb|b|', '\verb|c|', and '\verb|d|' are nonterminals or terminals that reduce to nonterminal '\verb|a|':
\begin{verbatim}
a : b c d
\end{verbatim}
Multiple rules for the same nonterminal can be written within the same docstring using the following syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
a : b c d
  | e f g
\end{verbatim}
The start rule for the grammar is the nonterminal '\verb|file|', as specified by the variable '\verb|start|'.
\subsection{Abstract Syntax Tree}
Parsed input is stored in an abstract syntax tree (defined in \verb|cspy_data_structs.py|; see Data Structure documentation for more details). For each function, the variable '\verb|p|' is an iterable whose indices correspond to a nonterminal or terminal in the grammar rule. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
a    :  b    c    d
p[0]    p[1] p[2] p[3]
\end{verbatim}
All non-terminals on the right hand side of the grammar rule evaluate to abstract syntax trees representing the expansion of said terminal. For example, if '\verb|b|' was a non-terminal, the value of \verb|p[1]| would be an abstract syntax tree corresponding to the grammar rule '\verb|b : l m n|' where '\verb|l|', '\verb|m|', and '\verb|n|' are terminals or nonterminals. The value assigned to \verb|p[0]| is the value which gets returned by a parsing rule function. The majority of parsing functions assign \verb|p[0]| to an abstract syntax tree, e.g. \verb|p[0] = ast(p, label, children*)| where '\verb|p|' is itself, '\verb|label|' is a string which is the identifier of the abstract syntax tree node, and children are the indices of \verb|p| that need to be stored in the abstract syntax tree. From the above example, if you wanted to store the value of '\verb|b|' and '\verb|d|', but not '\verb|c|' in an abstract syntax tree, you would write the following line of code:
\begin{verbatim}
p[0] = ast(p, "A NODE", 1, 3)
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Error Reporting}
In addition to containing the grammar rules for the CSPy language, cspy parser.py also contains additional grammar rules which contain the special '\verb|error|' token, which accounts for the possibility of syntax errors. Use of this token allows the parser to recover and resynchronize itself to continue parsing the remainder of a CSPy program after encountering a syntax error. This process is described in detail in the PLY documentation, under the section 'Recovery and synchronization with error rules'. A simple example, taken from the CSPy grammar, is described below.

\begin{verbatim}
def p_declaration_error(p):
    'declaration : IDENTIFIER COLON error EQUALS expression '
    print("invalid type\n")
\end{verbatim}

A variable can either be declared or declared and initialized simultaneously. The above rule corresponds to the latter. A variable declaration is defined to be an identifier followed by a colon and a type identifier. An equals sign followed by an expression signifies a variable initialization. '\verb|x:int = 4|' is an example of a valid declaration with an initialization step that contains no syntax errors.

'\verb|x:7 = 7|' is clearly not a valid variable declaration, as both '\verb|7|'s are classified as integer literals by the parser. What follows the colon must be a type identifier, such as '\verb|int|' or '\verb|bool|'. In the case that what follows the colon is not a valid identifier or is a reserved word, in the above example, everything following the colon up to the equals sign ('\verb|7|') will be matched to the special '\verb|error|' token and the following actions will be taken:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|p_error|, the parsing error message function, will be invoked with the '\verb|error|' token as its sole argument.
  \item \verb|p_error| will display the CSPy line and line number the error occurred on along with '\verb|^|'s pointing to the error and a message identifying it as a syntax error.
  \item The parser will exit from \verb|p_error| and \verb|IDENTIFIER COLON| error \verb|EQUALS| expression will reduce to declaration, invoking \verb|p_declaration_error|, which will display the message "invalid type" to elaborate on the nature of the syntax error.
  \item The error token will go away and the parser will attempt to continue parsing the CSPy program from the \verb|LexTokens| which follow the expression.
\end{itemize}
Note that the '\verb|error|' token should never appear on the end of the right hand side of a grammar rule, as it will make resynchronization more difficult once the rule is reduced. For more information and examples, see the PLY documentation.
\subsection{Precedence}
\verb|cspy_parser.py| contains a tuple named '\verb|precedence|' which lists the precedence of specific tokens. Tokens are listed in precedence order of lowest to highest. Each entry in the precedence list is also a tuple whose first element is a string corresponding to the associativity of the token(s). The remaining elements in the tuple are the names of the token(s). Consider the following two entries from the precedence list:
\begin{verbatim}
('left', 'PLUS', 'MINUS'),
('left', 'TIMES', 'DIVIDE', 'MODULO', 'INTDIV')
\end{verbatim}
Because they are listed below the '\verb|PLUS|' and '\verb|MINUS|' tokens, '\verb|TIMES|', '\verb|DIVIDE|', '\verb|MODULO|', and '\verb|INTDIV|' have higher precedence. All six of these tokens are left-associative.
\subsection{Output}
A CSPy program with no syntax errors will produce a single abstract syntax tree. The parser also produces the following files each time changes are made to the grammar, which are automatically generated:
\begin{itemize}
\item parser.out \\
Contains a written version of the grammar described in \verb|cspy_parser.py| and the parsing table as well as any \verb|S/R| or \verb|R/R| conflicts if they exist. Text file for personal use, debugging, etc.
\item parsetab.py \\
A Python version of the PLY parsing table for use during the parsing process. DO NOT edit.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Language}
There are currently almost 300 CSPy grammar rules, automatically generated by the parser and stored in the file parser.out. This can be found in Appendix 1 of this document.

\section{CSPy Data Structures Documentation}
\verb|cspy_data_struct.py| contains class definitions for the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item AST (abstract syntax tree)
\item DeclarationException
\item NotYetDeclaredException
\item SignatureException \\
\end{itemize}

It also contains the following global variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|binary_overload|: 

Dictionary which associates binary operators to the names of their
corresponding binary overload functions
\item \verb|unary_overload|: 

Dictionary which associates unary operators to the names of their
corresponding unary overload functions
\item \verb|holds_env|: 

List containing labels of all AST nodes that contain environments
\end{itemize}
\subsection{AST Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|label:string| 

The name of the node. See parser defs for node names (e.g. '\verb|INTLITERAL|').
\item \verb|type:type_obj| 

The type of the node. Defaults to None. The type of the node is altered by the function \verb|det_type| (found in \verb|cspy_type_checker.py|), which sets the type attributes for all of the nodes in the AST.
\item \verb|children:list of ast| 

A list of all the children of the current node. Children are usually abstract syntax trees but may occasionally be strings. Children can be accessed through the overloaded indexing operator (\verb|n.children[0]| is equivalent to \verb|n[0]|).
\item \verb|parent:ast| 

The parent of the current abstract syntax tree node (the node in the tree which contains the current node as a child). All nodes have a parent except for the root of the tree, whose parent is \verb|None|.
\item \verb!env:dict of [string|type_obj]! 

A dictionary representing the environment contained by the current AST node. Only nodes whose labels are in \verb|holds_env| will have an env attribute defined.
\item \verb!python_env:dict or [string|type_obj]!

A dictionary representing the environment variables that originated from a python import. Only \verb|FILE| nodes will have a \verb|python_env| attribute defined.
\item \verb|lineNum:int| 

The number in the CSPy source file indicating where the code this node holds resides.
\item \verb|endLineNum:int| 

The number in the CSPy source file indicating where the code this node holds ends.
\item \verb|position:int| 

The index of the first character of code from the CSPy source file the current node holds.
\item \verb|endPosition:int| 

The index of the last character of code from the CSPy source file the current ast node holds.

\item \verb|column:int| 
The index of the first character of CSPy code the current node holds with respect to the line number the code is one. The function \verb|set_column_node(sourceCode)| must be called on the root of the tree in order to initialize this attribute.

\item \verb|endColumn:int| 
The index of the last character of CSPy code the current node holds with respect to the line number the code is one. The function \verb|set_column_node(sourceCode)| must be called on the root of the tree in order to initialize this attribute.

\item \verb|line:int| 
The line of CSPy where the code contained within the current node is found.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{AST Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|__init__(p:YaccProduction, label:string, *children:int)|

Constructor for an AST node. Receives a YaccProduction \verb|p| which is the parsing symbol the AST represents, a string \verb|label| which is the name and type of the node, and a tuple of integers \verb|children| which are the indices of p that should be added to the current node's children attribute.
\item \verb|set_column_num(s:string)| 

Sets the values of the column, endColumn, and line attributes for the current node and for all of the children of the current node. Receives a string \verb|s| which is the CSPy source code.
\item \verb|add_children(children:list of int, p:YaccProduction)| 

Given a list of integers \verb|children| which are the indices of \verb|p| to be added to the children of the current node.
\item \verb|lookup_var(var:string) -> type_obj or [type_obj]| 

Looks up \verb|var|, the name of the variable being looked up, and returns the type object or a list of type objects (in the case of overloaded functions or procedures) if \verb|var| has been declared in the node's current scope (or its parent scopes). If the variable does not exist, a \verb|NotYetDeclaredException| is raised.
\item \verb|initiate_var(var:string, typ:type_obj)| 

Given a string \verb|var|, the name of the variable being initialized, and \verb|typ|, the type of \verb|var|, adds \verb|var| to the current node's environment. If the variable already exists, its value is not a function or procedure, or \verb|typ| is not a function or procedure, a \verb|DeclarationException| is raised. If the variable already exists and its value is a function or procedure, or if \verb|typ| has the same signature as its values, a \verb|SignatureException| is raised.
\item \verb|initiate_python_var(var:string, typ:type_obj)|

Given a string \verb|var|, the name of the variable being initialized, and \verb|typ|, the type of \verb|var|, adds \verb|var| to the file's \verb|env| and \verb|python_env| dictionaries. If the variable already exists, a \verb|DeclarationException| is raised.
\item \verb|is_class_var(var:string)|

Looks up \verb|var| and returns whether \verb|var| is a local class variable. 
\item \verb|is_python(var:string)|

Looks up \verb|var| and returns whether \verb|var| was imported from a python program. If the variable is found at any point in the syntax tree before reaching the \verb|FILE| node, then \verb|False| is returned since the local environment has overridden the python import variable.
\item \verb|flatten(label:string) -> list of ast| 

Flattens the current tree and returns a list of tree nodes whose label attribute is label.
\item \verb|__getitem__(index:int) -> ast| 

Overloads the indexing operator for an AST. Returns the AST from the current AST's children attribute whose index is index.
\item \verb|__setitem__(index:int, value:ast)| 

Overloads the indexing assignment operator for an abstract syntax tree. Sets the value of current AST's children attribute at index to value.
\item \verb|__repr__() -> string| 

Returns a string representation of the current abstract syntax tree.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exceptions}
Exceptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item DeclarationException 

Raised if a variable declaration fails.
\item NotYetDeclaredException 

Raised if a variable has not been declared.
\item SignatureException 

Raised if a function or procedure has already been declared with a given signature.
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak

\section{CSPy Generate Environments Documentation}
Description: \verb|cspy_genenv.py| generates environments, assigning variables to their appropriate scopes, within an AST parse tree.
\subsection{Detailed Process}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tree traversal: The function \verb|generate_environments| is called by the master program and is passed a parse tree. It calls \verb|tree_pass|, which traverses the tree and delegates the environment building by calling functions based on the label of the current node; most of the functions in this file are named with the format \verb|g_NODE|, where NODE is the label of a parse tree node. Only nodes pertaining to scope have functions in this file.
\item Node functions: These functions take an AST node \verb|n| as their argument. Each node function begins with a comment explaining the children of the received node:
\begin{verbatim}
    def g_declaration(n):
         # 0: identifier; 1: type
        (NOTE: 0 means n[0]; 1 means n[1])
\end{verbatim}
Then each node function performs the appropriate tasks for its given node. The AST is edited to add objects to nodes that can hold environments. Some functions check for errors, usually when some object (a variable, a class, a function) has already been declared in the current scope and the user is attempting to declare it again.
\item Error reporting: When an error is found, the imported function \verb|type_error|, contained in\\ % Page overflow problem
\verb|cspy_type_checker.py|, is called to display a formatted and educational error message. As the goal is to help beginning programmers learn, these messages are as descriptive yet simple as possible. \verb|type_error| receives a message as a string, and at least one AST node. The node(s) passed to \verb|type_error| holds the section of code that contains an error. Please see documentation on cspy \verb|cspy_type_checker.py| to read more about \verb|type_error|.
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak

\section{CSPy Type Checker Documentation}
Description: \verb|cspy_type_checker.py| handles the semantic type-checking of a CSPy program via an abstract syntax tree whose environments have already been generated (see \verb|cspy_genenv.py| documentation for more information).
\begin{itemize}
\item Traversing a CSPy AST: The main function, \verb|det_type|, receives an abstract syntax tree. It traverses the tree, calling type checking functions based on the label of the current node. All of the type checking functions in this file are named with the format \verb|s_NODE|, where \verb|NODE| is the label of a parse tree node. This file contains additional helper functions as well, whose identifiers are not preceded by an '\verb|s_|'.
\item Type Checking: Each type checking function (prefixed with an '\verb|s_|') receives an AST node \verb|n| as its sole argument. The first line of every function is a comment with the indices and descriptions of the node's children (taken from \verb|cspy_parser.py|):
\begin{verbatim}
    def s_member(n):
        # 0: object; 1: attribute terminal
        (NOTE: 0 means n[0]; 1 means n[1])
\end{verbatim}
Each type checking function performs the tests appropriate for the given node. If there is a type error, the function calls \verb|type_error|, an error reporting function which receives an error message (a string) and the tree node(s) where the error occurred. For detailed information on the specific type requirements checked by each node function, see documentation on Type Checking Functions.
\item Error Reporting: When a type error is found, \verb|type_error| is called to display a detailed error message, containing the line and column number of the error, and a short description of what went wrong. These error messages are written for beginners and aim to use simple language to give the user helpful information about the error. The following occurs for every node passed to \verb|type_error|:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The line and column number of the start of the code containing the error is displayed, along with the type of the node containing the error, if one exists.
\item The line of code from the source file containing error is output and underlined  with the symbol '\verb|^|', highlighting the portion of code within the line where the error occurred.
\item Finally, \verb|type_error| displays the given error message.
\end{enumerate}
For example, below is a CSPy program along with the error message for the type error it contains:
\begin{verbatim}
    :: p : list of int = [1,2,3] ::
    for item in p:
        print(item + "!")

    --------------------------------------------------------
    CSPy : Type Error
    Line 3, Column 11: int
    print(item + "!")
          ^^^^

    Line 3, Column 18: string
    print(item + "!")
                 ^^^

    The binary operator '+' is defined for the left-hand side (int),
    but it does not have a signature matching the right-hand side (string).
    --------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\section{CSPy Translator Documentation}
Description: \verb|cspy_translate.py| handles the translation of CSPy to Python 2.7 when given a type-checked parse tree.
\subsection{Detailed Process}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up: The function \verb|translate| is called by the master program and is passed a parse tree and the name of the CSPy file. Within \verb|/tmp/$USER|, it creates a file with the same filename but with the extension .py, then calls \verb|toPython| on the parse tree to begin translation.
\item Tree traversal: The function \verb|toPython| traverses the tree and delegates translation by calling functions based on the label of the current node; most of the functions in this file are named with the format \verb|c_NODE|, where \verb|NODE| is the label of a parse tree node. This file contains additional helper functions as well, whose identifiers are not preceded by a '\verb|c_|'.
\item Node functions: These functions take three arguments: an AST node (child), a file object (file), and the current indentation level as measured by strings such as "\verb|\t\t|" (tabs - set to a default of an empty string). Each node function begins with a comment explaining the children of the received node:
\begin{verbatim}
    def c_MEMBER(child, file, tabs=""):
        # 0: identifier; 1: attribute name
        (NOTE: 0 means child[0]; 1 means child[1])
\end{verbatim}
Then each node function calls \verb|toPython| on any appropriate children, and/or outputs Python code to the output file.
\begin{itemize}
\item e.g. when \verb|toPython| sees a node labeled "FILE", it will call \verb|c_FILE|, which in turn calls \verb|toPython| on all of its children (docstring, import block, declaration suite, and block) to be further broken down.
\item e.g. when \verb|toPython| sees a node labeled "\verb|LITERAL_STRING|", it simply writes the string to the output file because there is no more breaking down needed.
\end{itemize}
\item Line mapping: At the end of every output with a new line (such as any single statement), the current line number in the output file is saved in a dictionary as the key to the current CSPy file line number. When translation is complete, a new file is created with the same filename plus "\verb|_linemap.py|". The dictionary of the Python and CSPy line numbers is written to this file to be used for error reporting during runtime. See the documentation of \verb|cspy_runtime.py| for more details.
Additional Notes:
\item Irregular keywords: This file includes a dictionary "\verb|replace|" that holds a handful of specific keywords that need to be replaced when translating. For example, "\verb|&&|" is a valid operator in CSPy, but must be replaced with "\verb|and|" when translating to Python.
\item Global variables: This file includes several global variables that are generally used in situations where a node function may need information that is not present in its received node. For example, \verb|in_class| keeps track of whether or not the translator is currently writing a class definition; this variable is necessary in, for example, \verb|c_DECLARATION_SUITE|, in order to decide between writing a normal series of variable declarations and writing an \verb|__init__| method to declare class attributes. (More details on the global variable \verb|last_var| in "Class constructors" below, and on \verb|assign_me| in "Overloaded functions" below.)

\item Class constructors: In CSPy, creating an instance of a user-defined class looks like:
\begin{verbatim}
    myPet : Pet = Pet("Spot")
\end{verbatim}
% where the user-defined constructor is named after the class. In order to handle class attributes, this translator writes an \verb|__init__| method consisting only of the class definition's main variable block (i.e. the class attributes). So when a class instance is created - using the above example - the translator outputs \verb|myPet = Pet()|, which will call the \verb|__init__| to declare the class attributes, and then outputs \verb|myPet.Pet("Spot")|, which will call the user-defined constructor as a method. (The line mapping is adjusted accordingly.) However, the variable \verb|myPet| is not passed to \verb|c_CONSTRUCTOR_CALL|, and so a global variable, \verb|last_var|, is used to access this identifier in order to output the call of the user-defined constructor. Also note that a class may have multiple constructors defined (see "Overloaded functions" below). REPLACE WITH UPDATED INIT METHOD
\item Overloaded functions: CSPy allows for overloaded function signatures, i.e. function definitions that share the same name but accept different parameters. (Note: though in CSPy terms a "function" returns a value and a "procedure" is void, in this case function is simply a general term; procedures may also be overloaded.) Of course, this means no two functions may share the same name and the same list of parameter types, as the functions are distinguished by their parameter type lists. In translation, this overloading is handled by changing the names of the functions. When translating a function definition, if the value of the identifier in the node's parent environment is a list, then the identifier is associated with more than one function, and thus is overloaded. The name of each overloaded function is translated to the following format:
\verb|_funcname_params|. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
    def myFunc (x:int) -> _myFunc_int
    def myFunc (x:string) -> _myFunc_string
    def myFunc (x:string, y:int) -> _myFunc_string_int
\end{verbatim}
When a function is called, the translator again checks if the function is overloaded. If it is, the translator uses the above established format to find the translated function name, but this time using the types of the given arguments instead of the defined parameter types. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
    myFunc(6) -> _myFunc_int(6)
    myFunc("hi") -> _myFunc_string("hi")
    myFunc("hi", 3) -> _myFunc_string_int("hi", 3)
\end{verbatim}
In this way, all the overloaded functions are translated into their own separately named and callable functions in the Python file.

If a user is attempting to assign an overloaded function to a variable, the global variable \verb|assign_me| comes into play. \verb|assign_me| holds the name of the identifier to which a value is being assigned. In \verb|c_VARIABLE|, the identifier's type is looked up (it matches that of an overloaded function) and its parameter type list is passed on to \verb|overload_name| in order to assign the correct overloaded function to the variable.
% Import sys + sys.path.append explanation
\item Import readline: \verb|readline| is a module imported into each translated Python file. Adding this allows for the use of \verb|input()| in .cspy files. Rather than determine whether or not a given file will require the module, the translator simply outputs this import statement to every Python executable. See \verb|cspy_runtime.py| documentation on "Running the file" for a more detailed explanation.
\end{itemize}

\section{CSPy Runtime Documentation}
Description: \verb|cspy_runtime.py| runs the Python executable file as the final step in the compilation process, handles any runtime errors, and removes all the extraneous files which were created throughout the compilation process.
\subsection{Detailed Process}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up: The function run is called by the master program and is passed the name of the CSPy file and a list of imported module names. It checks if the Python executable exists. If it doesn't, something unexpected has gone wrong somewhere in the compilation process, and \verb|cspy_runtime.py| throws an exception.

\item Running the file: Many methods have been tested for this purpose, all with various pros and cons. Currently runtime is using \verb|os.system|  to execute the Python file. Though many sources say the \verb|subprocess| module is a better choice, it does not appear to easily allow the function \verb|input()| (more details in "Other run methods" below). \verb|os.system| calls a bash command to run the Python executable and pipe any \verb|stderr| (standard error) into a text file. Any intended output from the executable prints to the terminal, and any input during runtime is entered into the terminal.

(NOTE: \verb|os.system| also had some difficulty with \verb|input()|, namely that it considered input prompts to be in the same category as \verb|stderr| and therefore output these to the text file instead of the terminal. Research appears to show this is an unresolved bug. One forum coder's suggestion was to simply include \verb|import readline| in the Python file. This miraculously works, allowing the use of \verb|input()|, and so the translator currently imports readline into every Python executable. A messy fix, perhaps, and one that may have unforeseen consequences, but currently not a gift horse we're looking in the mouth.)
\item Error reporting: When an error is found, this file formats the error message to be more beginner-friendly. The error message is read in from the text file specified above. In the traceback, every pair of lines consists of the file info and the appropriate line of code. (Note: All files present in the traceback should be Python files.) Below is an example Python error message straight from the terminal:
\begin{verbatim}
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "ex.py", line 4, in <module>
            divide(6)
        File "ex.py", line 3, in divide
            y = x / 0
    ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
\end{verbatim}
A regular expression is used to extract the filename and the line number from the first line of each pair of lines in the traceback. Then, using the predetermined naming format \verb|filename_linemap.py|, the Python-to-CSPy linemap dictionary created in \verb|cspy_translate.py| is imported (more details in "Line mapping" below). This allows run to convert the extracted line number to the CSPy file's line number, to properly pinpoint the erroring code in the user's .cspy file. Once all the lines have been processed, the given error message is printed, followed by the traceback. Below is the CSPy version of the above error message:
\begin{verbatim}
    THERE IS AN ERROR IN FILE 'ex.cspy', LINE 4:

    y = x / 0

    ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero

    TRACEBACK:
    File 'ex.cspy', line 6:
        divide(6)
    File 'ex.cspy', line 4:
        y = x / 0
\end{verbatim}
\item Removing files: Whether there's a runtime error or not, at the end this program removes the traces of compilation from \verb|/tmp/$USER| using the function \verb|remove_files|. This removes the temporary folder.

\end{itemize}
Additional Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line mapping: The system for importing the line map dictionary is to use the python pickle module to export the linemap dictionary to the \verb|_linemap| file during translation, and then during runtime use
\begin{verbatim}
    line_map = pickle.load(open("/tmp/$USER/file_linemap", "rb"))
\end{verbatim}
to load the dictionary.
\item Other run methods: Ignoring the aforementioned issue of \verb|input()|, the best method found so far was to use the module \verb|subprocess.Popen| to attempt to run the Python executable - as it sounds, this module creates a subprocess in which to execute its given command. If there was a runtime error, the error message was retrieved from the process - using the Popen method \verb|communicate()| - and saved to a variable:
\begin{verbatim}
    new_process = subprocess.Popen(['python', filename],
    stderr = subprocess.PIPE)
    error = new_process.communicate()[1]
\end{verbatim}
The issue with this is that the function \verb|input()|, which introductory students will likely use often to interact with their programs, will not work unless you explicitly use \verb|communicate()| each time input is needed. It is not efficiently possible to plan for these \verb|input()| calls. Other methods of subprocess besides Popen (such as call or \verb|check_output|) may or may not be able to handle \verb|input()|, but regardless do not allow piping the standard error and so do not allow the formatting and line number swapping which we require. Therefore, we chose to use \verb|os.system| and a less sophisticated method of standard error piping.

\section{CSPy Header File Documentation}
\subsection{Introduction}
This section discusses the usage and implementation of the "\verb|pyimport|" function for using Python classes with CSPy.
\subsection{How To Use Imports From Python}
Importing from Python requires a \verb|.cspyh| file, known as a CSPy header file. For example, if you want to import Python's math module, you need to look at its documentation and write a .cspyh file which contains the function defintions and class definitions within the math module in a special format.

The construction of header files is very similar to the syntax for writing functions. Below is a sample implementation of Python's \verb|math| module:
\begin{verbatim}
    :: pi : float, e : float ::

    # rounding functions
    def floor(x : float) -> float
    def ceil(x : float) -> float

    # exponential and extra functions
    def factorial(x : int) -> int
    def exp(x : float) -> float
    def log(x : float, base : ?float) -> float
    def sqrt(x : float) -> float
    def pow(x : int, y : int) -> int

    # trig functions
    def acos(x : float) -> float
    def asin(x : float) -> float
    def atan(x : float) -> float
    def atan2(x : float, y :float) -> float
    def cos(x : float) -> float
    def sin(x : float) -> float
    def tan(x : float) -> float
    def degrees(x : float) -> float
    def radians(x : float) -> float
\end{verbatim}

Most functions in this module are omitted because we don't anticipate that introductory students would want to use functions like \verb|math.fmod(x, y)| over \verb|x % y|. The header file approach to importing from Python gives freedom to the developer to pick and choose which functions an introductory student should use.

Each function you want to give access to CSPy needs to be written in a syntax CSPy can parse. Global constants use global variable syntax, and any function definition or process has to match what is returned and what parameters are given. For example, given the function \verb|floor(x)|, you need to specify its return type (\verb|float|), and what type \verb|x| is (\verb|float|).

Classes are constructed in a very similar manner:
\begin{verbatim}
    class A:
        ''' This is a class docstring '''
        :: x:int, y:float ::
        def A(x:int, y:float)
        def show() -> tuple of (int * float)
\end{verbatim}

Header files can also contain \verb|pyimport| statements at the top of the header file in the same format as the CSPy syntax.

Once you have the header files finished, importing is as simple as typing \verb|pyimport module| at the beginning of the CSPy file. Each variation on this (like \verb|from module pyimport *| or \verb|pyimport module as mod|) is supported.

\subsection{How It Works}
CSPy header files are lexed, parsed, and type checked in a very similar manner to CSPy's own lexer, parser, and type checker. Since the syntax for header files varies from CSPy's syntax, different files (\verb|cspy_header_lexer.py|, \verb|cspy_header_parser.py|, \verb|cspy_header_genenv.py|,\\ % Page overflow problem
\verb|cspy_header_translate.py|) are used.

The big difference between the backend for CSPy header files and CSPy files is that a lot of syntax is removed, such as the syntax for loops, conditionals, and the colon after a function definition. This is because the header files just need to know the function's description, not its inner workings. Otherwise, these CSPy header files look and act similarly to CSPy's own files. All of the same roles and details are in both, so there is no need to restate each file's role in the process.

When an error is found, a \verb|type_error| is thrown, resulting in a CSPy Header Type Error being thrown with the line number and subsequent line as output.

\section{CSPy Text Editor Documentation}
\subsection{Introduction}
This section discusses the CSPy Text Editor, predominantly built by Paul Magnus and Ines Ayara. Its backend is built off of Tkinter, and its UI/UX is based off of Sublime Text 2. It has two themes: Solarized Dark, and Solarized Light, which use the color scheme made by Ethan Schoonover (see his documentation at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized for more information).
\subsection{Features}
Currently the following features are supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item File opening, editing, and saving (basic I/O)
\item Copy, cut, paste, undo, redo
\item Select all, expand selection to line, expand selection to word
\item Find and replace
\item Submission and execution of code to external system
\item Configuration of font and theme
\item CSPy syntax highlighting
\item Tab system for handling several .cspy files at once
\item Tracking of line number and column number
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Why We Made The Choices We Made}
The previous version of an editor for the introductory course was Pynt, an online editor built by Emily Sears and Kat Fuzesi in 2015 for python programming. While it had a cloud-based setup and was a lot easier to use than emacs for beginning programmers, it tended to slow down, especially when used for the graphics projects. It also was a pain for grading purposes, due to it being slow to test more complex programs (like ones that use the cs110graphics library). So we felt that the UI/UX for our text editor shouldn't be toy-like and should allow for easy coding and execution, with keyboard shortcuts that most people were used to. 

Even though our text editor runs on a GNU/Linux server, the keyboard shortcuts are bound to the program, and are similar to ones in Windows and Macintosh programs. The system avoids using bash and terminal emulation to access and make files although creation of folders is still left to the user to do through the terminal or some other means. The execution and submission of code is handled so that the user does not have to run the cspy command mentioned earlier in this document.

Our UI is loosely based off of editors such as Sublime Text. We chose to design it off of Sublime Text because we perceived it to be easy to use and powerful. The intent of this was to make the user feel like they were coding in a real IDE. Yes, vim and emacs have been around for a long time and are industry standards, but both of these are complex at first glance and have a lot of features that even programmers don't use daily.

Aspects of the user interface were designed to help promote good code. Each line is 79 characters long, which follows PEP 8 style guidelines. After the user types 79 characters, the rest of the code he types will be in red, as a warning that they need to make their code shorter.

Tabs follow PEP 8 style guidelines and are replaced with 4 spaces. While the language is more responsible for teaching good habits, the UI needs to aid in this goal. As a result, syntax highlighting on CSPy commands is necessary, and was one of the first things we built into the program.

\section{CSPy Graphics Library Documentation}
\subsection{Introduction}
This section discusses the back end of the cs110graphics library, built predominantly by Matthew R. Jenkins '20, which is used in tandem with CSPy Text Editor to teach object oriented programming to beginning CS students. It is implemented in Tkinter, and is built off of a foundation by Professor Mark Bailey and subsequent improvements by Emily Sears and Kat Fuzesi in 2015.

\subsection{How The Frontend Works (From CSPy Ulysses Documentation For Teacher And Student Documentation)}

\subsubsection{The Basics}
To import the library, the line "\verb|from cs110graphics pyimport *|" needs to be the first line of your program. To put objects into the Graphics System, it requires a function which takes an object of type Window as a parameter.
\begin{verbatim}
    def function(win:Window):
\end{verbatim}
There are seven types of objects you can add to a window. Text, Image, Oval, Circle, Rectangle, Square, and Polygon. Each has its own method of initalization and requires specific parameters, but like the above function, each function requires a window object as the first parameter.

\begin{verbatim}
    def function(win:Window):
        ::circ:Circle::
        circ = Circle(win, 40, (200, 200))
        win.add(circ)
\end{verbatim}

To start the graphics system, instead of initalizing a function by calling it, you would wrap the function in a function called \verb|StartGraphicsSystem|. 
\begin{verbatim}
    def function(win:Window):
        ::circ:Circle::
        circ = Circle(win, 40, (200, 200))
        win.add(circ)

    StartGraphicsSystem(function)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{circle}
\centering
\captionof{figure}{The above code yields a circle of radius 40 in the center of the window.}
\end{figure}

The next page contains all of the graphical objects which are included in the graphics library, as well as sample code and implementations.

\begin{itemize}
\item Text requires a string of text, but can optionally take a font size and a center.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{text}
\captionof{figure}{Text(win, "Hello, World!", 12, (200, 200))}
\end{figure}

\item Image requires a name of an image, which has to be in the current working directory. It can optionally take a width, a height, and a center. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{image}
\captionof{figure}{Image(win, "Lenna.png", 100, 100, (200, 200))}

\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{oval}
\captionof{figure}{Oval(win, 40, 60, (200, 200))}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{square}
\captionof{figure}{Square(win, 40, (200, 200))}

\subsubsection{More Specific Methods}
Objects of type \verb|GraphicalObject| have access to \verb|GraphicalObject| methods, and Objects of type \verb|Fillable| have access to \verb|Fillable| methods, as well as \verb|GraphicalObject| methods. Some classes even have their own methods which can be accessed only by them.
\vskip.2in
\verb|GraphicalObjects| are all seven types of object that can be put on the canvas. They have the following methods accessible:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|add_handler(graphic:GraphicalObject)| - initalizes an EventHandler on the object and allows for overwriting of EventHandler functions by the class. (See Event Handling later in this section.)
\item \verb|get_center() -> tuple of (int * int)| - returns the center of the \verb|GraphicalObject|.
\item \verb|get_depth() -> int| - returns the depth of the \verb|GraphicalObject|.
\item \verb|move(dx:int, dy:int)| - Moves a \verb|GraphicalObject| dx pixels horizontally and dy pixels vertically.
\item \verb|move_to(point:tuple of (int * int))| - moves the center of a \verb|GraphicalObject| to the point.
\item \verb|set_depth(depth:int)| - sets the depth of the \verb|GraphicalObject|.
\end{itemize}
\vskip.2in
\verb|Fillables| are five of the objects that can be put on the canvas. They can have their fill colors and border colors changed, among other things. The \verb|Circle|, \verb|Oval|, \verb|Rectangle|, \verb|Square|, and \verb|Polygon| objects are all \verb|Fillables|.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|get_border_color() -> string| - returns the border color of a Fillable.
\item \verb|get_border_width() -> int| - returns the border width of a Fillable.
\item \verb|get_fill_color() -> string| - returns the fill color of a Fillable.
\item \verb|get_pivot() -> tuple of (int * int)| - returns the pivot point of a Fillable.
\item \verb|rotate(degrees:int)| - rotates a Fillable by degrees.
\item \verb|scale(factor:float)| - scales a Fillable's size by the scale factor. 
\item \verb|set_border_color(color:string)| - sets the border color of the Fillable.
\item \verb|set_border_width(width:int)| - sets the border width of the Fillable.
\item \verb|set_fill_color(color:string)| - sets the fill color of the Fillable.
\item \verb|set_pivot(pivot:tuple of (int * int))| - sets the pivot point of the Fillable.
\end{itemize}
You can either use names of colors like "\verb|yellow|", or you can use hexadecimal numbers in a string like "\verb|#FFFF00|" to set a color.

\item \verb|resize(width:int, height:int)| - resizes an Image by width and height.
\item \verb|rotate(degrees:int)| - rotates an Image by degrees.
\item \verb|scale(factor:float)| - scales an Image's size by scale factor
\item \verb|size() -> tuple of (int * int)| - returns a tuple of the width and height of an Image.

\end{itemize}
Text methods (not including any inherited methods from GraphicalObject):
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|set_text(text:string)| - Sets the text of the Text object.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|set_side_lengths(width:int, height:int)| - sets the width and height of the Rectangle. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Event Handling}
Event handling is the computer science term for sending keyboard and mouse commands to a graphical interface. The graphics library supports a rudimentary version of event handling.

There are two classes which do the work: \verb|Event|, and \verb|EventHandler|. \verb|Event| takes an keyboard or mouse event and converts it to a format which can be read by \verb|EventHandler|. In \verb|Event|, you can get the location where the event occurred, the mouse button that did it, the keyboard button that did it, or a description of the event. This is useful for handling different kinds of button input.
\vskip.1in
Below is a list of Event's methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|get_button() -> string| - returns the mouse button that generated the event. It will be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Left Mouse Button
\item Middle Mouse Button
\item Right Mouse Button
\end{itemize}
\item \verb|get_description() -> string| - returns the description of the event. It will be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Key Press
\item Key Release
\item Mouse Press
\item Mouse Release
\item Mouse Move
\item Mouse Enter
\item Mouse Leave
\end{itemize}
\item \verb|get_key() -> string| - returns the key that was pressed or released.
\item \verb|get_location() -> tuple of (int * int)| - returns the location of the mouse on the canvas.
\item \verb|get_root_location() -> tuple of (int * int)| - returns the location of the mouse on the monitor.
\end{itemize}

\verb|EventHandler| is a class which contains what is executed when an event is sent to specific objects. It is designed so that the user can overwrite the functions in the class and replace it with their own functions.
\vskip.1in
The functions that can be overwritten are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|handle_key_press(event:Event)| - handles a key press. 
\item \verb|handle_key_release(event:Event)| - handles a key release. 
\item \verb|handle_mouse_enter(event:Event)| - handles when the mouse enters an object. 
\item \verb|handle_mouse_leave(event:Event)| - handles when the mouse leaves an object. 
\item \verb|handle_mouse_move(event:Event)| - handles mouse movement. 
\item \verb|handle_mouse_press(event:Event)| - handles a mouse press. 
\item \verb|handle_mouse_release(event:Event)| - handles a mouse release. 
\end{itemize}

To overwrite, the user has to extend EventHandler and initalize it in their custom class:

\begin{verbatim}
class Button extends EventHandler:
    :: circ:Circle::
    def Button(win:Window):
        EventHandler.EventHandler()
        circ = Circle(win)
        win.add(circ)
        circ.add_handler(self)
\end{verbatim}

The user has defined a class called Button, which takes no parameters. The EventHandler is initalized, the Button's representation is made, and then the Button gets the ability to overload functions in EventHandler using the \verb|add_handler()| function.

To overwrite a function, all you have to do is define a function that matches the names of the functions you want to overwrite. If for example, the user wants the circle's color to change when they click on it, they would do this:

\begin{verbatim}
def handleMouseRelease(event:Event):
    circ.set_fill_color("yellow")
\end{verbatim}

After that is written by the user and run, the object's fill color will turn yellow when it is clicked. 

Each function requires an object of type Event to be attached so that if the user wants to know more details about the EventHandler, they can access the Event methods discussed above. For example, what if the user wants to know where the mouse was clicked within an object? The user would then use the Event class and call getMouseLocation() to find out:

\begin{verbatim}
def handleMouseRelease(event:Event):
    print(event.getMouseLocation())
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Animations}

There are two ways to do animations. One is to use the Timer class. When initalized, a Timer takes a window, a delay (in milliseconds), and a function. The timer will re-run the function after each delay of time. To start the timer, call the \verb|start()| function. To stop the timer, call the \verb|stop()| function.

\begin{verbatim}
class Button:
    :: circ:Circle, timer:Timer, pressed:bool ::
    def Button(win:Window):
        circ = Circle(win)
        win.add(circ)
        timer = Timer(win, 200, flash)
        pressed = False
        timer.start()

    def flash():
        if pressed:
            circ.set_fill_color("")
            pressed = False
        else:
            circ.set_fill_color("yellow")
            pressed = True
\end{verbatim}

This code example has several parts to it. It first initalizes a Circle, a Timer and a Boolean. It creates the circle, adds it, creates the timer, sets the boolean to False, then starts the timer. The timer then runs the function \verb|flash|, which sets the fill color to yellow, then after 200 seconds sets it to be transparent.

Another way to do animations is to run an instance of the \verb|RunWithYieldDelay| class. This class takes a function which has the CSPy keyword \verb|yield| and then allows that function to run with a delay.

\begin{verbatim}
def main(win:Window):
    :: circ:Circle ::
    circ = Circle(win)
    win.add(circ)
    RunWithYieldDelay(win, move_circle(circ))

def move_circle(circ:Circle) -> generator of int:
    for i in range(10):
        circ.move(10, 0)
        yield 200
    raise StopIteration
\end{verbatim}

This function will keep running until the for loop stops.

\subsection{How The Backend Works}

Admittedly, it's very hard to describe the rationale behind certain design choices without leaving out details, but I'm going to try my best.

To start, I modeled my version of the graphics library to be very similar to Professor Bailey's and Emily Sears'. I did modify all of the functions behind it to fit to PEP8 style guidelines (for example, everything before was camelCase but now it's snake\_case). Consistency is something that we're trying to aim for with CSPy so I think following PEP8 guidelines is a good start to this.

The backend is built off TKinter. The Window object is where everything TKinter related lives, as it contains the Frame, the Canvas object, and a list of all objects. The list contains 3 elements: the object's depth, the object's tag, and the object itself. The tag is the alias of the object and any modifications such as tag binding are done to it.

When an object is made, it is created in its constructor (using TKinter's \verb|create_polygon| or \verb|create_image| or \verb|create_text| methods) and automatically added to the Window but it's marked as hidden/disabled. When the object is added to the Window using the \verb|Window.add()| method, it becomes visible and interactable. When it is removed using the \verb|Window.remove()|, it is removed from the canvas and the graphic list, the tag is set to none and the object is disabled.

Each object's constructor takes different formal parameters, but generally save to the same four attributes: a Window object, a width, a height, a center. From there the object generates a different polygon depending on its constructor: squares and rectangles generate 4 points, and then is added, but ovals and circles have a function \verb|_circle_gen| which generates a circle or oval. Each object is mutable after it is made, whether it be setting its dimensions or colors. Any change has to result in a tag change, because when an object is changed in most cases, a new object has to be made which is built off whatever change is requested (so if you want to rotate an oval 40 degrees, the oval has to have all of its points modified so that it's 40 degrees to the left, and then recreated and saved to that tag).

The Hierarchy is as follows:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hierarchy}
\captionof{figure}{This is the basic hierarchy of the graphics library.}
\end{figure}

Functions like \verb|StartGraphicsSystem| and \verb|RunWithYieldDelay| are omitted from this hierarchy, as I wanted to show the relationship between each class with this diagram. 

EventHandling is bound on an object by object basis. Originally I thought that all of the keybinds had to be made as soon as the window was initalized and then they were overwritten by the user and their objects, but this ultimately ended up causing redundancies. The \verb|add_handler| function now does the binding. If it's a key based bind, it is added to the canvas, but if it's a mouse based bind, it is bound to the graphic. \verb|add_handler| passes the graphic's version of any EventHandler function to a function called \verb|call_handler|, which either adds an event if it's found in the function or omitted. 

Animations have both Timer and RunWithYieldDelay. Originally I thought by forcing the window to update (instead of using a mainloop) that RunWithYieldDelay would be rendered unnecessary, but it turns out that RunWithYieldDelay uses a different method of animation than I originally thought. It uses a generator, and at first I thought it would be too niche of an addition to the language, but I couldn't find any other way that wasn't either dangerous (like graphical threading) or impractical (like omitting the function altogether and encouraging the user to use the Timer class for all animations).

I like to think that my code is self documenting, and I tried my best to make it simple to read and simple to diagnose. If you're confused about anything, please feel free to email me at mjenkins@hamilton.edu.

\section{Future Development Recommendations}
At the present moment, the only recommendations we can think of are improving CSPy and fixing any bugs we failed to notice, improving the graphics library by adding new functions and new features, and improving the design and implementation of the CSPy Text Editor.

(NOTE: In Python, bool is a subclass of Integer, therefore Integer binary operators such as '+', '-', etc. would be applicable to Boolean values as well. This is not the case in CSPy, as there is no benefit for a beginner programmer to use any of these operators on boolean.) \\

\textbf{Tuples:} A sequence type.
Tuples are heterogeneous, and can contain elements of multiple types. Tuples are also immutable and can't be changed once created.
\vskip.1in
Binary Operators: \\

\item List, Set or Frozenset via \verb|tolist|, \verb|makeset| or \verb|frzset| built-in functions (only applicable for homogeneous tuples)
\end{itemize}
Additional Operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tuples support indexing, slicing, membership testing, iteration, and use of the \verb|len()| function. Tuples do not support augmented assignment (they are immutable). 
\end{itemize}
(NOTE: The methods for tuples have generic “object” return types because the return type of these operators depends on the type of the tuple. Since tuples can contain multiple types unlike lists, the return type of a slicing or indexing operation is determined in the type checker by analyzing the elem\_type list of the tuple. Because it is impossible to determine the return type of an indexing or slicing operation of a multi-typed tuple using a variable as an index, indexing tuples with variables is NOT allowed. 
\begin{center}
\verb|mytuple[2]| \verb|->| acceptable \\
\verb|mytuple[p]| \verb|->| unacceptable
\end{center}
Similarly, because it is impossible to determine the type of an iterative variable in a for loop iterating over a multi-type tuple, tuples DO NOT support iterating.)

\end{itemize}
Additional Operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dictionaries support indexing, slicing, membership testing, iteration, and use of the len() function. 
\end{itemize}
\vskip.2in

\textbf{Sets and Frozensets:} \\ 
An unordered collection of unique elements. Sets  and frozensets are homogeneous, i.e. they can only contain one element type. Sets are mutable but frozensets are immutable.

\item List, Set or Frozenset via \verb|tolist|, \verb|makeset| or \verb|frzset| built-in functions
\item Bool via \verb|tobool| built-in function
\end{itemize}
Additional Operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sets and frozensets support membership testing and iteration. Sets support augmented assignment. Frozensets do not (they are immutable). 
\end{itemize}
\vskip.2in
\textbf{Functions:} \\
A function is a procedure that returns a value. Functions have a return type. All of the return statements in a function must be nonempty and their return value must have the same type as the function’s return type.

CSPy supports function overloading, provided that each function or procedure has a distinct parameter list. (NOTE: See CSPy Grammar Rules - Functions and Procedures for more details.)

A declared variable may be bound to a function:
\begin{verbatim}
    f:fn (int, int) -> int = add
\end{verbatim}
The above will assign the overloaded add function corresponding to the given type signature to f. Similarly, the below example is also valid because the type of the anonymous function matches the type of f:
\begin{verbatim}
    f:fn (int, int) -> int = lambda (x:int, y:int) -> int : (x + y)
\end{verbatim}
(NOTE: \verb|fn (int, ?int) -> int| is not equivalent to \verb|fn (int, int) -> int|. The \verb|?| symbol in the first function type indicates the second integer is an optional parameter.  This is the same for procedures.)
\vskip.2in

\textbf{Procedures:} \\
A procedure does not return a value and hence has no return type. Procedures support function overloading as well. (NOTE: See CSPy Grammar Rules - Functions and Procedures for more details.)

Declared variables may be bound to procedures using the following syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
    p:proc (int) = output
\end{verbatim}
\vskip.2in

\textbf{Files:} \\
Files are the type for a Python file object. A file is created by using the built-in open() function. Attributes of the file type are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|closed:bool| - True if the file is closed, False otherwise.
\item \verb|name:string| - The name of the file.
\item \verb|mode:string| - The mode which the file was opened with.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{File Built Ins:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|close()| \\
Closes the file. A closed file cannot be read or written to anymore. Any operation which requires that the file be open will raise a ValueError is the file is closed. Calling close more than once is allowed. 

\item \verb|flush()| \\
    Flushes the internal buffer. 

\item \verb|fileno() -> int| \\
Returns the integer file descriptor that is used by the underlying implementation to request I/O operations from the operating system.
